# Object-Oriented Programing
###\* [OOP basics](https://www.imaginarycloud.com/blog/functional-programming-vs-oop/#key)
Object-oriented programming is an imperative programming paradigm,
that organizes data and the software structure based on the concept of classes and objects.


###\* Class
Classes are a set of instructions (or blueprints) that establish a data structure for a specific object,
determining what the object will contain (the types of variables that can exist in an object)
and how it will behave (the methods or member functions that define how to operate on the variables).
Thus, objects are instances of classes since classes work as "templates" to create objects.
Plus, objects can contain data in the form of fields (also known as attributes)
and code in the form of procedures (also named methods).
###\* Instance
Instance is a concrete occurrence of any object, existing usually during the runtime of a computer program.
Formally, "instance" is synonymous with "object" as they are each a particular value (realization),
and these may be called an instance object; "instance" emphasizes the distinct identity of the object.
The creation of an instance is called instantiation.
###\* Method
###\* Abstract Class
###\* Interface
###\* Encapsulation
Encapsulation is an ability to encapsulate variables within a class from outside access.
Properties and methods can be private or public.
OOP languages allow developers to establish multiple degrees of visibility.
###\* Polymorphism
Polymorphism is the provision of a single interface to entities of different types.
The concept is borrowed from a principle in biology where an organism or species can have many different forms or stages.
Entries can have more than one form.
###\* Inheritance
It allows classes to inherit states and behaviors from their superclasses,
which also means that this principle supports re-usability.
###\* Abstraction
Hides complex details to reduce complexity.
